## Helix Assignment

To run the project, simply add the file `env.ts` into the `src/` directory and place the following contents inside (replacing where appropriate):

```
export enum config {
    VISION_API_KEY = 'REPLACE_ME_WITH_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY'
} 
```

Then run `npm i` to install all dependancies and `npm start` to run!
